| Mod | URL | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `RimSaves` | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1713367505 | Since it allows for the creation of local folders for saves, it breaks the path where the mod is supposed to look for a save to upload to the server, therefore not allowing to save at all progress. |
| `Zetrith's Multiplayer` | https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2606448745 | Breaks the mod without any possibility of working, complex multiplayer mods are not meant to work together. |
| `SOS2` | https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1909914131 | Breaks many of the functions RimWorld Together has, such as trading, caravans, settlements, etc. |
| `Prepatcher` | https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2934420800 | On some cases only, might prevent the mod from starting correctly. Might depend on loading priority. |
| `SRTS` | https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1845423808 | Breaks raiding / spying / visiting due to the mod not using vanilla caravan code, similar mods might produce same results. |
